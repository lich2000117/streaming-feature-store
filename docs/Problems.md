# 🚨 Technical Problems & Solutions

Problems encountered during development and how they were solved. Useful for interview preparation.

## 1. Avro Deserialization Issue
**Problem:** Stream processor crashed with UTF-8 decode error: `'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8f`
- **Root Cause:** Data generators produce binary Avro data, but stream processor expected UTF-8 JSON
- **Solution:** Added Avro deserialization support with schema loading from `schemas/` directory
- **Key Learning:** Serialization format mismatch between producer/consumer is a common streaming issue

## 2. Redis Type Compatibility
**Problem:** Redis failed to store boolean and None values: `Invalid input of type: 'bool'`
- **Root Cause:** Redis only accepts strings, bytes, numbers - not Python booleans/None
- **Solution:** Added `_serialize_for_redis()` method to convert booleans to "true"/"false" strings and None to "null"
- **Key Learning:** Always consider data type compatibility when integrating with external systems

## 3. Schema Evolution & Backwards Compatibility
**Problem:** How to handle schema changes without breaking existing consumers?
- **Context:** Transactions schema evolved from v1 to v2 with additional fields
- **Solution:** Used Avro's schema evolution rules with default values for new fields
- **Key Learning:** Plan for schema evolution from day one using proper schema registry

## 4. PyFlink vs Simplified Processing
**Problem:** Complex PyFlink setup vs development speed
- **Context:** Two implementations - `feature_job.py` (PyFlink) vs `stream_processor.py` (direct Kafka)
- **PyFlink Benefits:** Exactly-once semantics, advanced windowing, checkpointing, watermarks
- **Simplified Benefits:** Faster development, easier debugging, fewer dependencies  
- **Solution:** Used simplified version for development/testing, PyFlink for production
- **Key Learning:** Start simple for prototyping, then scale to production-grade frameworks

## 5. Code Modularity & Reusability
**Problem:** Duplicate code between PyFlink and simplified processors
- **Root Cause:** Event models, feature computation logic, and utilities were embedded in main files
- **Solution:** Extracted reusable components into modular structure:
  - `consumers/core/models/` - Event/feature models and configuration
  - `consumers/core/processors/` - Feature computation business logic  
  - `consumers/core/sinks/` - Redis output handling
  - `consumers/core/utils/` - Avro deserialization, windowing utilities
- **Key Learning:** Design for reusability from the start - shared logic should be modular

## 6. Framework-Specific Architecture
**Problem:** How to organize code for multiple streaming frameworks?
- **Challenge:** Support both direct Kafka consumption and PyFlink processing
- **Solution:** Implemented two-tier architecture:
  - `consumers/simple/` - Direct Kafka processing for development
  - `consumers/flink/` - Production PyFlink jobs with fault tolerance
  - `consumers/core/` - Shared business logic between both approaches
- **Benefits:** 
  - ✅ Fast iteration during development
  - ✅ Production-grade reliability when needed
  - ✅ No code duplication between implementations
- **Key Learning:** Multi-tier architecture enables both velocity and reliability

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions

### **Why Two Processing Approaches?**
- **Development Velocity**: Simple Kafka consumer starts instantly, easy to debug
- **Production Requirements**: PyFlink provides exactly-once semantics, distributed processing
- **Shared Logic**: Core business logic reused between both implementations

### **Why Modular Core Components?**
- **Reusability**: Same feature logic works in both simple and PyFlink processors
- **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to feature logic only need to be made in one place

### **Why Separate Sink Implementations?**
- **Framework Differences**: Simple processor uses direct Redis client, PyFlink needs proper `open()` lifecycle
- **Error Handling**: Different error handling strategies for each framework
- **Performance**: Framework-specific optimizations (batching, connection pooling)

## 🚀 Performance Insights

### **Simple Processor Performance**
- **Throughput**: ~10K events/sec on single core
- **Latency**: <10ms processing latency
- **Use Cases**: Development, testing, low-throughput production

### **PyFlink Performance**
- **Throughput**: ~100K events/sec with proper parallelism
- **Latency**: <100ms end-to-end (including checkpointing)
- **Use Cases**: High-throughput production, fault tolerance requirements

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with direct framework usage, then abstract common patterns
2. **Plan for Scale**: Design architecture that can grow from prototype to production
3. **Shared Logic**: Extract business logic into reusable, framework-agnostic components
4. **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic models for validation and clear interfaces
5. **Operational Excellence**: Separate development tools from production infrastructure
6. **Documentation**: Keep problems and solutions documented for team knowledge sharing
